    <h1>about</h1>
    <p>
      I am a fourth-year undergrad student at the University of Chicago expecting to graduate 
      in spring of 2024. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a 
      specialization in Computer Systems. I am double minoring in Astronomy and Astrophysics 
      and History. I am the vice president of the UChicago Men's Club Ice Hockey team and a 
      member of the UChicago climbing club URock. I am interested in technology, specifically 
      software engineering and how persistent computing and software can solve everyday problems. 
      I also like developing random programs and games for my own enjoyment. A long term goal of 
      mine is to completely build a computer from scratch (both hardware and software).
      <br><br>
      Outside of school, I love being active and exploring the world. My most frequent activities 
      include climbing, hiking, running, hockey, soccer, reading, going to museums, and video 
      games. I love watching hockey, soccer, and Formula 1. I often find myself distracted while 
      learning about random facts or following the news (tech, financial, political, science, space) 
      or consuming as much Monty Python content as possible before discovering that the day is 
      suddenly over. I also love traveling and have passable German skills (if I was stuck with 
      only German speakers, I think I would survive) that I am working on improving.
